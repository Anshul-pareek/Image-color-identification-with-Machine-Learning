# Image-color-identification-with-Machine-Learning
Developed a machine learning-based color detection system using Sklearn, Numpy, and OpenCV


Requirements:

1. Python Environment: Install Python from Python Downloads.
2. Libraries:Install required libraries using pip: pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn opencv-python pandas scikit-image
3. Code Editor or IDE: Choose a code editor or IDE such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebooks, or Spyder.
Image for Testing:
4. Prepare an image file for color detection.
5. Update the image file path in the get_image function accordingly.
6. Operating System: The code is compatible with various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
   
Ensure that your system meets the general requirements for running Python code.
